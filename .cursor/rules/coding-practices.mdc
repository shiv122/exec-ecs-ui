## Error Handling
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging

## Performance
- Use lazy loading for routes when appropriate
- Debounce user inputs when needed
- Optimize terminal rendering

## Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize command arguments
- Never execute arbitrary shell commands

## Code Quality
- Keep components small and focused
- Use composables for reusable logic
- Follow Rust best practices for memory safety
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code

## Resource Management
- Ensure proper cleanup of resources (event listeners, processes, terminals)
- Use TypeScript/JavaScript consistently (don't mix patterns)
